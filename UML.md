    <h1>Low-Level Design (LLD) Preparation for Interviews</h1>
    <p>This repository is designed to help you prepare for Low-Level Design (LLD) interviews by focusing on UML Class Diagrams, which are a critical part of system design and object-oriented programming.</p>
    <h2>What is a UML Class Diagram?</h2>
    <p>A UML (Unified Modeling Language) Class Diagram is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects.</p>
    <h2>Key Components of a UML Class Diagram</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Class:</strong> A blueprint for creating objects. It contains attributes (properties) and methods (functions).</li>
        <li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Variables that belong to a class and define the state of an object.</li>
        <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Functions that define the behavior of a class.</li>
        <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Associations, inheritance, dependencies, and aggregations that define how classes interact with each other.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Types of Relationships in UML Class Diagrams</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Inheritance (Generalization):</strong> Represents an "is-a" relationship where one class is a subclass of another.</li>
        <li><strong>Association:</strong> Represents a "has-a" relationship between two classes.</li>
        <li><strong>Aggregation:</strong> A special type of association that represents a "whole-part" relationship.</li>
        <li><strong>Composition:</strong> A stronger form of aggregation where the part cannot exist without the whole.</li>
        <li><strong>Dependency:</strong> Indicates that one class depends on another, but the relationship is not as strong as association.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Use This Repository</h2>
    <p>This repository contains examples of UML Class Diagrams for various common design problems that are often asked in LLD interviews. Each example includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A problem statement.</li>
        <li>A UML Class Diagram solution.</li>
        <li>Explanation of the design decisions.</li>
        <li>Code implementation (if applicable).</li>
    </ul>
 <h2>Examples Included</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Design a Parking Lot System</li>
        <li>Design a Library Management System</li>
        <li>Design a Online Shopping System</li>
        <li>Design a Social Media Platform</li>
    </ul>
